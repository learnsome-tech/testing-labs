# m01l01-03 · The claim, written down

**Lesson:** [The Cost And Value Of A Test](https://learnsome.tech/learn/testing-course/m01l01) (lesson 1.1, module 1: What A Test Is For) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can say what a test buys you and what it costs to keep, and you can watch a test catch a regression the moment somebody introduces it.

In the lesson: Now the claim. Import the function, hand it two lines, and assert that the answer is one thousand pence. The name of the test is the sentence it checks, so when it fails the report reads like English instead of like a stack trace. Notice what is absent: no setup, no base class, no assertion library. Pytest collects any file whose name begins with test underscore, calls any function whose name begins with test underscore, and trusts the plain assert statement that Python already has. In other ecosystems this is where you would wire up a runner. Here there is nothing to wire. Let us run it and watch for the dot.

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l01/m01l01-03/starter`
2. Read `test_cart.py`.
3. Run it: `python3 -m pytest -q test_cart.py`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l01-03`.

## Expected output

```text
.                                                                      [100%]
1 passed in 0.00s
```

## How to check

`./check m01l01-03` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m pytest -q test_cart.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. The pytest report is compared by its outcome, not its text: which tests passed, failed or errored, and the final tally (warnings and timings do not count). A pass here is a pass on the site.
