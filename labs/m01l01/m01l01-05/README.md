# m01l01-05 · The test catches it

**Lesson:** [The Cost And Value Of A Test](https://learnsome.tech/learn/testing-course/m01l01) (lesson 1.1, module 1: What A Test Is For) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can say what a test buys you and what it costs to keep, and you can watch a test catch a regression the moment somebody introduces it.

In the lesson: Run the suite again, with the short traceback flag so that the whole report stays on one screen. It fails, and the report tells you four things: which test, which line, what the expression really came to, and what it was supposed to come to. Nine hundred is not one thousand. Nobody had to notice. Nobody had to remember that carts are priced in pence, or that a flat discount applied to an empty basket hands money back to the customer. That is the thing you bought when you wrote three lines of test, and it arrived on the first morning it was needed.

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l01/m01l01-05/starter`
2. Read `test_cart.py`.
3. Run it: `python3 -m pytest -q --tb=short test_cart.py`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l01-05`.

## Expected output

## How to check

`./check m01l01-05` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m pytest -q --tb=short test_cart.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. The pytest report is compared by its outcome, not its text: which tests passed, failed or errored, and the final tally (warnings and timings do not count). A pass here is a pass on the site.
