# m01l01-04 · A change that looks harmless

**Lesson:** [The Cost And Value Of A Test](https://learnsome.tech/learn/testing-course/m01l01) (lesson 1.1, module 1: What A Test Is For) · Free  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can say what a test buys you and what it costs to keep, and you can watch a test catch a regression the moment somebody introduces it.

In the lesson: A week later somebody adds a launch discount: a flat hundred pence off every cart. It is two lines, it reads well, the docstring is updated, and the author checked it by hand on a cart with three items and got the number they expected. Nothing here looks dangerous. This is exactly the shape of the change that breaks something quietly: small, plausible, well intentioned, and inside a function that the rest of the system leans on. Without a test, the next person to find out is a customer with an empty basket being told that the shop owes them money.

## Files

- [`starter/cart.py`](starter/cart.py): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/cart.py` alongside the lesson.
2. Follow it the way the lesson builds it:
   - Lines 1–2: the docstring is updated
   - Lines 3–4: a flat hundred pence

## How to check

**Read along.** It is a listing to read alongside the lesson, not a program to run.

There is nothing to check: `./check m01l01-04` says so and moves on.
