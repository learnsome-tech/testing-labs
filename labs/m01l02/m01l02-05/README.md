# m01l02-05 · How a phased test fails

**Lesson:** [Arrange, Act, Assert](https://learnsome.tech/learn/testing-course/m01l02) (lesson 1.2, module 1: What A Test Is For) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can write a test in three visible phases, and you can show that the phases make the failure report easier to read than a one line test.

In the lesson: Read the failure. Because the act had a name, the assertion line is short and the report is short with it: twelve hundred and fifty is not twelve hundred. One expression, two numbers, no noise. You know immediately that the money came out too high and by how much, and you can go looking for the reason with a number in your hand. Keep that report in mind for the next screen, because we are about to write the same test as a single clever line and watch the report get worse.

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l02/m01l02-05/starter`
2. Read `test_pricing.py`.
3. Run it: `python3 -m pytest -q --tb=short test_pricing.py`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l02-05`.

## Expected output

```text

## How to check

`./check m01l02-05` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m pytest -q --tb=short test_pricing.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. The pytest report is compared by its outcome, not its text: which tests passed, failed or errored, and the final tally (warnings and timings do not count). A pass here is a pass on the site.
