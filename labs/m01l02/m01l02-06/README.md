# m01l02-06 · The same test, all on one line

**Lesson:** [Arrange, Act, Assert](https://learnsome.tech/learn/testing-course/m01l02) (lesson 1.2, module 1: What A Test Is For) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can write a test in three visible phases, and you can show that the phases make the failure report easier to read than a one line test.

In the lesson: Same claim, same bug, one line. Plenty of people write tests this way and call it concise. Here is the same failure. Pytest is generous: it unwraps the expression and shows you each intermediate value, the twelve hundred and fifty and the thousand it came from. But you are now reading a nest of calls to find the subject of the test, and every extra call in that nest adds a line of explanation to every future failure. Concise in the editor, expensive in the report, and the report is where you will actually be living.

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l02/m01l02-06/starter`
2. Read `test_pricing.py`.
3. Run it: `python3 -m pytest -q --tb=short test_pricing.py`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l02-06`.

## How to check

`./check m01l02-06` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m pytest -q --tb=short test_pricing.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. The pytest report is compared by its outcome, not its text: which tests passed, failed or errored, and the final tally (warnings and timings do not count). A pass here is a pass on the site.
