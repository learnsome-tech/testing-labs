**Lesson:** [The Test Pyramid And Where It Is Wrong](https://learnsome.tech/learn/testing-course/m01l04) (lesson 1.4, module 1: What A Test Is For) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can explain what the test pyramid is really a picture of, mark the slow tests in your suite, and select or deselect them by marker.

In the lesson: Two tests: one pure, one marked slow because it waits on something outside this process. Ask pytest for the slowest tests and the numbers speak. The marker says what the test needs, not what it asserts. The unit test is too fast to measure and pytest hides it. The slow one takes a third of a second, which sounds harmless until you have four hundred of them and your suite takes two minutes for every one line change. Multiply by the number of times a day you want to run it, and that is the whole argument about the shape of a suite, in one report.

- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l04/m01l04-05/starter`
2. Read `test_layers.py`.
3. Notes from the lesson:
   - Line 12: The marker says what this test needs, not what it asserts
4. Run it: `python3 -m pytest -q --durations=3 test_layers.py`.
5. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l04-05`.

## Expected output

```text
..                                                                     [100%]
============================ slowest 3 durations =============================
0.36s call     test_layers.py::test_the_price_service_answers

(2 durations < 0.005s hidden.  Use -vv to show these durations.)
2 passed in 0.36s
```

## How to check

`./check m01l04-05` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m pytest -q --durations=3 test_layers.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. The pytest report is compared by its outcome, not its text: which tests passed, failed or errored, and the final tally (warnings and timings do not count). A pass here is a pass on the site.
