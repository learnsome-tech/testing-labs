# m01l04-06 · Choosing a layer by marker

**Lesson:** [The Test Pyramid And Where It Is Wrong](https://learnsome.tech/learn/testing-course/m01l04) (lesson 1.4, module 1: What A Test Is For) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can explain what the test pyramid is really a picture of, mark the slow tests in your suite, and select or deselect them by marker.

In the lesson: Now deselect the slow ones. One passed, one deselected, and the run is instant. This is the command you bind to a key and run on every save. The full suite, slow tests included, runs when you push, and the truly slow end to end checks run on a schedule or before a release. That is what the pyramid buys you in practice: not a ratio to report to a manager, but a set of commands at different prices, so that the fast one can be run constantly and the expensive one is not the thing standing between you and a green tick.

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l04/m01l04-06/starter`
2. Read `test_layers.py`.
3. Run it: `python3 -m pytest -q -m "not slow" test_layers.py`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l04-06`.

## Expected output

```text
.                                                                      [100%]
1 passed, 1 deselected in 0.00s
```

## How to check

`./check m01l04-06` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m pytest -q -m "not slow" test_layers.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. The pytest report is compared by its outcome, not its text: which tests passed, failed or errored, and the final tally (warnings and timings do not count). A pass here is a pass on the site.
