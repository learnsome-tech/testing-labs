# m01l03-04 · Three claims in three tests

**Lesson:** [One Assertion Per Reason](https://learnsome.tech/learn/testing-course/m01l03) (lesson 1.3, module 1: What A Test Is For) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can split a test so that each one fails for exactly one reason, and you can explain why the first failing assertion hides every assertion after it.

In the lesson: Now run the same three claims as three tests. The traceback is switched off here so that the summary is all you see, which is often how you want to read a first failure. One passed, two failed, and both bugs are on the screen at the same time. The names tell you which claim broke without your having to open the file, and each name is a sentence somebody could have written in a ticket. Same assertions, same code, same second of machine time, twice the information, because nothing was hiding behind anything else.

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l03/m01l03-04/starter`
2. Read `test_pricing.py`.
3. Run it: `python3 -m pytest -q --tb=no test_pricing.py`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l03-04`.

## Expected output

```text

```

## How to check

`./check m01l03-04` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m pytest -q --tb=no test_pricing.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. The pytest report is compared by its outcome, not its text: which tests passed, failed or errored, and the final tally (warnings and timings do not count). A pass here is a pass on the site.
